## 🚩 Running R Programs in [Rstudio Cloud](https://posit.cloud/)

In this module, I will do a step-by-step explanation of **how to use R programming language in Rstudio Cloud**. Conventionally we needed to install **R software**, _which is a programming language_ and **R studio**, _which is an integrated development environment (IDE) to run R programs_, in our local machines (our computers, laptops, etc.).

Alternatively, we can now use the cloud version of this IDE without having to install them (taking space in our computer disk memory) via web browser.

Please follow the instruction below to get started programming in R with Rstudio Cloud.

### 1. Open browser and go to Rstudio Cloud webpage

You can go to [this link](https://login.rstudio.cloud/) or type it manually to your browser's tab *https://login.rstudio.cloud* and press 'enter' to go to the R studio Cloud page.

### 2. Sign-in Options

You will see the default sign-in option and two provider options such as **Sign in with Google** and **Sign in with Github**. My suggestion is to use either provider instead of setting up a new account because it is simpler.

If you do not have an account for **Github** or you never really used **Github** before, I would choose to sign in with **Google**.

Since I will be storinng my source projects via Github, I am going to sign in with Github, but there SHOULD NOT have differences between the providers when it comes to programming R in RStudio Cloud.

I will go ahead and click **sign in with github** button and allow github to let me login in Rstudio Cloud website.

### 3. Direct to Posit Cloud

Once you sign in, you will see three different buttons, but just click on **Posit Cloud** to direct yourself to the Rstudio Cloud workspace interface.

### 4. Navigation Bar (Left)

Once we are directed to the workspace interface, we will see the left navigation bar with a bunch of buttons in the column.
Do not get overwhelmed by them because all we need to have is the top button where it says '+ New Space'.

### 5. Create Workspace For the Class

Go ahead click that 'New Space' button and name it as you wish. I will name it 'PSC103A' since I will primarily use this specific workspace for our specific class.

**NOTE** that it is always good practice to seperate files by what they are used for. Since we will be writing a bunch of R programs for this speicfic class PSC 103A, I will only use this space for this class but nothing else.

Once you created the space, click on it and now let's dive into the interface on the right.

### 6. Creating Project

We just created a workspace for our class. Now it is time to create our first project. Whenever it says **project**, you can think of it as a **program**. Since it is most likely that we will have a lot of programs and each of our programs will do their own and independent things, we should name them in the way we (or our teammates) would know what those projects do.

For a practice, let's create a project by clicking 'New Project' button at the right top. (Make sure you click 'New Rstudio Project') because that will be what we will be using.

**Optional (Github User)** if you are planning to push & pull from a github repository, you can go ahead and configure them (create repository & pull from it) as you wish.

Once you created a new Rstudio the project, it immediately directs you to the studio interface where the title of project is **Untitiled**. I am going to retitle it with 'Test Rstduio Project'.

I am gonna do a simple program execution by typing the following in the console bar.

```
> 1 + 1
```

and press enter. Then the output I get is as follows

```
> 1 + 1
[1] 2
```

```
> 1 + 1 // what I typed
[1] 2 // what the program executed and logged
```

### 7. 👏 Voila

If you are still here. Now you can be a smart R programmer who can do the following things.

- [ ] Using Rstudio Cloud
- [ ] Creating Custom Workspace In Rstudio Cloud
- [ ] Creating Various R projects in Different Custom Workspaces in Rstudio Cloud

If you still have trouble adopting to this environment, you can contact me via email - [hanchoi@ucdavis.edu]() and I can help you set it up before or after class.

## 🚩 Preliminary Mathematics Quiz

To cope with the course material, we need basic understanding of some algebreic mathematics.

The problems along with its solutions are documented [here](./preliminary-math-quiz.md) or click on `preliminary-math-quiz.md` file to view.
